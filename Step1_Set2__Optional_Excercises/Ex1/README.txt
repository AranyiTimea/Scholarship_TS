We have the following structure of classes:
• The class Person.
• The class Student and the class Teacher, both descendants of Person.
• The class Student will have a public method "GoToClasses", which will write on
• screen "I’m going to class."
• The class Teacher will have a public method "Explain", which will show on screen
"Explanation begins". Also, it will have a private attribute "subject", a string.
• The class Person must have a method/property "SetAge (int n)" which will indicate the 
value of their age (eg, 40 years old). Also, a “Greeting” method that displays “Hello”.
• The Student will have a public method "ShowAge" which will write on the screen
o "My age is: 20 years old" (or the corresponding number).
Create the classes structure. Also, you must:
• Create a Person and make it say hello.
• Create a student, set his age to 22, tell him to Greet and display his age. Make him to go 
to
• the classes after.
• Create a teacher, 33 years old, ask him to say hello and then explain.
