Task: Write a program that takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd (e.g. 1234) and performs the following actions:
o Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example 1+2+3+4 = 10).
o Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (in our example 4321).
o Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (in our example 4123).
o Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (in our example 1324).
